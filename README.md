# Using SPIN to Verify Security Properties of Cryptographic Protocols

This repo contains source for the Promela code found in [this
paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-46017-9_14)
that illustrates use of the [SPIN model
checker](http://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html) to reveal flaws in
the [Needham-Shroeder Public Key
Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needham%E2%80%93Schroeder_protocol).

## Explanation

This simple example consists of three processes: the *initiator* (PIni
... known as "A" in this example), the *responder* (PRes ... known as "B"
in this example) and the *intruder* (PI) whose specification is found
in the file *ns1.pml*.  The specification is written in Promela.

![](ns_protocol_reduced.png)

The *ns1.pml* example uses a reduced model of the protocol in which
the trusted key server is left out.  In the reduced model, it is
assumed that A and B have access to each others' public keys (i.e.,
PK(A) and PK(B)) and private access to their own private keys (i.e.,
SK(A) and SK(B)).  In message 1, A sends a message consisting of a
nonce (Na) and its own identifier (A) to B encrypted with B's public
key: {Na, A}PK(B).  Next, in message 2, B sends a message
acknowledging receipt of the nonce (Na) with its own nonce (Nb) to A
encrypted with A's public key: {Na, Nb}PK(A).  Finally, in message 3,
A sends a message back to B with its nonce (Nb) encrypted with B's
public key: {Nb}PK(B).  In this example, there is an intruder (not
shown) that can intercept messages (aka "man-in-the-middle") and spoof
the initiator or responder.

A flaw is the protocol first identified by
[Lowe](http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/gavin.lowe/Security/Papers/NSPKP.ps)
is found automatically.  Indeed, 23 variants are found automatically
due to random interleavings of the different processes.  For example,

## Installation

1. [Download, build and install SPIN on your machine](http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/README.html)

2. Clone this repo

3. Change into the needham_shroeder_spin directory

4. Search for errors using the first Linear Temporal Logic Formula (ltl_0).  There should be no errors:

````
% spin -search -ltl ltl_0 ns1.pml

pan: ltl formula ltl_0

	assertion violations	+ (if within scope of claim)
	acceptance   cycles 	+ (fairness disabled)
	invalid end states	- (disabled by never claim)

  only one claim is used in a verification run
  choose which one with ./pan -a -N name (defaults to -N ltl_0)
  or use e.g.: spin -search -ltl ltl_0 ns1.pml

5. Search for errors using the second Linear Temporal Logic Formula (ltl_1).  There should be at least 1 error:

````
% spin -search -ltl ltl_1 ns1.pml

pan: ltl formula ltl_1
pan:1: acceptance cycle (at depth 28)
pan: wrote ns1.pml.trail
